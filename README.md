Text Generation With LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks in Python with Keras

In this post you will discover how to create a generative model for text, character-by-character using LSTM recurrent neural networks in Python with Keras.
After reading this post you will know:

- Where to download a free corpus of text that you can use to train text generative models.
- How to frame the problem of text sequences to a recurrent neural network generative model.
- How to develop an LSTM to generate plausible text sequences for a given problem.
